<h2> VizAPI Graph </h2>
<p> Each node is a set of one or more packages belonging to a jar. Packages are coalesced if they belong to the same jar and have the same incoming and outgoing edges.
Each edge is directed from the source package(s) to the target package(s) and is an interaction (invocations, fields, annotations, subtyping) between packages. 
Nodes are coloured based on the jar they belong to. Hovering on a node shows you the list of packages and the jar they belong to. <p>
